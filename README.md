# pi-sequence-finder
Pi Sequence Finder is a web app built with Flask and mpmath, allowing users to search for any numeric sequence within the first 100 digits of pi. It displays the sequence’s position or informs users if it’s not found. This project demonstrates the integration of web development and mathematical operations.
